# CookieClicker (Get Baked)

Made with **Unity 2019.2.8f1**  

# Objective

The gameplay is simple. Destroy the cookies by tapping on them before they fall past the screen. Cookies randomly spawn with 2 - 32 lives/taps to destroy them. There's also a small chance that a **broccoli** will spawn. Tapping a **broccoli** will slow down time for 5s.
